# Encryption Program

this is a Java Desktop program based onSwing GUI widget toolkit for Java to encrypt and decrypt the message using one-time pad (OTP) is an encryption technique that cannot be cracked, but requires the use of a single-use pre-shared key that is not smaller than the message being sent.

## Functionality
First : the user enters the message through text field label
second : the program will generate a random key
Third : the program will convert both the paintext (message) and random key to binary system
Forth : the program will apply XOR logical operator in binary system to generate Ciphertext
FIfth : the ciphertext will be displayed in screen
Sixth : the user should valid by click on verify button
seventh: decryption will happens and convert to origin message
eighth: the origin message will be displayed in the screen
ninth : if the user want to verify again it will not because the key is valid once
tenth: exit the program through close button in top left of the screen
